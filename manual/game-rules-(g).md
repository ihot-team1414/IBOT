# 7 Game Rules (G)

## [7.1 Personal Safety](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#_71-personal-safety)

### [G101 \*Humans, remain outside the \ \ FIELD\ \ .](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g101-humans-remain-outside-the-field)

A team member may not reach into the

FIELD

with any part of their body during a

MATCH

.

Violation: VERBAL WARNING. YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations during the event.

Violations of this rule apply to the entire team, not specifically to any 1 individual. For example, a member of Team 9999 reaches onto the

FIELD

during

MATCH

3, and a different member reaches onto the

FIELD

during

MATCH

25\. The team receives a VERBAL WARNING for the first violation and a YELLOW CARD for the second.

### [G102 \*Never step over the guardrail.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g102-never-step-over-the-guardrail)

A team member may only enter or exit the

FIELD

through open gates and only enter if

FIELD

lighting (

FIELD

facing side of the team signs and timers) is green, unless explicitly instructed by a

REFEREE

or an

FTA

.

Violation: VERBAL WARNING. YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations during the event.

Teams are encouraged to ensure that all members of their DRIVE TEAM are aware of this rule. It’s easy to violate, particularly when teams are doing their best to move on and off the

FIELD

quickly. The violations of this rule are intended to avoid nuisance penalties, but still enforce safety requirements around the

FIELD

. There is the potential for injury when stepping over the guardrail.

Violations of this rule apply to the entire team, not specifically to any 1 individual. For example, a member of Team 9999 steps over the guardrail prior to

MATCH

3, and a different member steps over the guardrail prior to

MATCH

25\. The team receives a VERBAL WARNING for the first violation and a YELLOW CARD for the second.

### [G103 \*Be careful what you interact with.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g103-be-careful-what-you-interact-with)

A team member is prohibited from the following actions with regards to interaction with

ARENA

elements.

A. climbing on or inside,

A. hanging from,

B. manipulating such that it doesn’t return to its original shape without human intervention, and

C. damaging.

Violation: VERBAL WARNING. YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations during the event.

The REBUILT

FIELD

has obstacles, and caution should be applied when navigating the

FIELD

. Teams should avoid carrying their

ROBOT

over the

BUMP

.

Walking over the

BUMP

is not considered climbing on.

### [G104 \*Teams may not enable their \ \ ROBOTS\ \  on the \ \ FIELD\ \ .](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g104-teams-may-not-enable-their-robots-on-the-field)

Teams may not tether to the

ROBOT

while on the

FIELD

except in special circumstances (e.g. after Opening Ceremonies, before an immediate

MATCH

replay, etc.) and with the express permission from the

FTA

or a

REFEREE

.

Violation: VERBAL WARNING. YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations during the event.

Teams are encouraged to consider this rule when developing their

ROBOTS

.

FMS

will not enable

ROBOTS

after the conclusion of the

MATCH

.

For the purposes of this rule, tethering includes any wired or wireless connection used to electrically energize and/or

control

elements on the

ROBOT

. The safety of teams and volunteers in close proximity to

ROBOTS

and

ARENA

elements on the

FIELD

is of the utmost importance, therefore

ROBOTS

or

ROBOT

COMPONENTS

may not be enabled in any way on the

FIELD

before or after the

MATCH

.

ROBOTS

need to be safely transported off the

FIELD

and back to the pits after the

MATCH

, and there may be bystanders, doorways, or height restrictions along the route.

## [7.2 Conduct](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#_72-conduct)

### [G201 \*Be a good person.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g201-be-a-good-person)

All teams must be civil toward everyone and respectful of team and event equipment while at a FIRST Robotics Competition event.

Violation: VERBAL WARNING. YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations during the event.

Examples of inappropriate behavior include, but are not limited to, the use of offensive language or other uncivil conduct.

Examples of particularly contemptible behavior that is likely to result in

ARENA

ejection include, but are not limited to, the following:

A. assault, e.g. throwing something that hits another person (even if unintended),

B. threat, e.g. saying something like “if you don’t reverse that call, I’ll make you regret it,”

C. harassment, e.g. badgering someone with no new information after a decision’s been made or a question’s been answered,

D. bullying, e.g. using body or verbal language to cause another person to feel inadequate,

E. insulting, e.g. telling someone they don’t deserve to be on a DRIVE TEAM,

F. swearing at another person (versus swearing under one’s breath or at oneself), and

G. yelling at another person(s) in anger or frustration.

### [G202 \*Don’t bang on the glass.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g202-dont-bang-on-the-glass)

A team member may never strike or hit the

DRIVER

STATION plastic windows.

Violation: VERBAL WARNING. YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations during the event.

### [G203 \*Asking other teams to throw a \ \ MATCH\ \  – not cool.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g203-asking-other-teams-to-throw-a-match-not-cool)

A team may not encourage an

ALLIANCE

of which it is not a member to play beneath its ability.

Note: This rule is not intended to prevent an

ALLIANCE

from planning and/or executing its own strategy in a specific

MATCH

in which all the teams are members of the

ALLIANCE

.

Violation: VERBAL WARNING. RED CARD if subsequent violations during the event.

Example 1: A

MATCH

is being played by Teams A, B, and C, in which Team C is encouraged by Team D to not get on the

TOWER

at the end of the

MATCH

, resulting in Teams A, B, and C not earning a Ranking Point. Team D’s motivation for this behavior is to prevent Team A from rising in the Tournament rankings and negatively affecting Team D’s ranking. Team D has violated this rule.

Example 2: A

MATCH

is being played by Teams A, B, and C, in which Team A is assigned to participate as a

SURROGATE

. Team D encourages Team A to not participate in the

MATCH

so that Team D gains ranking position over Teams B and C. Team D has violated this rule.

Example 3: Asking a team to “no show” for a

MATCH

.

FIRST considers the action of a team influencing another team to throw a

MATCH

, to deliberately miss Ranking Points, etc. incompatible with FIRST values and not a strategy any team should employ.

### [G204 \*Letting someone coerce you into throwing a \ \ MATCH\ \  – also not cool.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g204-letting-someone-coerce-you-into-throwing-a-match-also-not-cool)

A team, as the result of encouragement by a team not on their

ALLIANCE

, may not play beneath its ability.

Note: This rule is not intended to prevent an

ALLIANCE

from planning and/or executing its own strategy in a specific

MATCH

in which all the

ALLIANCE

members are participants.

Violation: VERBAL WARNING. RED CARD if subsequent violations during the event.

Example 1: A

MATCH

is being played by Teams A, B, and C. Team D requests Team C ignore the

TOWER

at the end of the

MATCH

, resulting in Teams A, B, and C not being able to earn the TRAVERSAL

RP

. Team C accepts this request from Team D. Team D’s motivation for this behavior is to prevent Team A from rising in the Tournament rankings negatively affecting Team D’s ranking. Team C has violated this rule.

Example 2: A

MATCH

is being played by Teams A, B, and C, in which Team A is assigned to participate as a

SURROGATE

. Team A accepts Team D’s request not to participate in the

MATCH

so that Team D gains ranking position over Teams B and C. Team A has violated this rule.

FIRST considers the action of a team influencing another team to throw a

MATCH

, to deliberately miss Ranking Points, etc. incompatible with FIRST values and not a strategy any team should employ.

### [G205 \*Throwing your own \ \ MATCH\ \  is bad.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g205-throwing-your-own-match-is-bad)

A team may not intentionally lose a

MATCH

or sacrifice Ranking Points in an effort to lower their own ranking or manipulate the rankings of other teams.

Violation: VERBAL WARNING. RED CARD if subsequent violations during the event.

The intent of this rule is not to punish teams who are employing alternate strategies, but rather to ensure that it is clear that throwing

MATCHES

to negatively affect your own rankings, or to manipulate the rankings of other teams (i.e. throw a

MATCH

to lower a partner's ranking, and/or increase the ranking of another team not in the

MATCH

) is incompatible with FIRST values and not a strategy any team should employ.

### [G206 \*Don't violate rules for \ \ RPs\ \ .](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g206-dont-violate-rules-for-rps)

A team or

ALLIANCE

may not collude with another team to each purposefully violate a rule in an attempt to influence Ranking Points.

Violation: YELLOW CARD and the

ALLIANCE

is ineligible for the BONUS

RPs

.

For example, if Team A on the blue

ALLIANCE

agrees with Team F on the red

ALLIANCE

to contact each other while each

ROBOT

is climbing the

TOWER

resulting in both

ALLIANCES

being awarded the TRAVERSAL

RP

.

### [G207 \*Don’t abuse \ \ ARENA\ \  access.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g207-dont-abuse-arena-access)

A team member (except

DRIVERS

, HUMAN PLAYERS, and DRIVE COACHES) granted access to restricted areas in and around the

ARENA

(e.g. via

TECHNICIAN

button, event issued Media badges, etc.) may not assist or use signaling devices during the

MATCH

. Exceptions will be granted for inconsequential infractions and in cases concerning safety.

Violation: VERBAL WARNING. YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations during the event.

The

TECHNICIAN

’S role is to help the team prepare the

ROBOT

so it can perform at its full potential during a

MATCH

. The

TECHNICIAN

, except as described at the end of section 6.2 DRIVE TEAM, is not an additional DRIVE COACH,

DRIVER

, or HUMAN PLAYER.

Team members in open-access spectator seating areas are not considered to be in a restricted area and are not prevented from assisting or using signaling devices. See E102 for related details.

### [G208 \*Show up to your Qualification \ \ MATCHES\ \ .](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g208-show-up-to-your-qualification-matches)

If a

ROBOT

has passed initial, complete inspection, at least 1 member of its DRIVE TEAM must report to the

ARENA

and participate in each of their assigned Qualification

MATCHES

.

Violation:

DISQUALIFIED

from the current

MATCH

.

Figure 7‑1

MATCH

participation flowchart

![image](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2026/Manual/HTML/2026GameManual_files/image047.png)

The team should inform the Lead Queuer if the team’s

ROBOT

is not able to participate.

### [G209 \*Keep your \ \ ROBOT\ \  together.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g209-keep-your-robot-together)

A

ROBOT

may not intentionally detach or leave a part on the

FIELD

.

Violation: RED CARD.

### [G210 \*Don’t expect to gain by doing others harm.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g210-dont-expect-to-gain-by-doing-others-harm)

A strategy not consistent with standard gameplay and clearly aimed at forcing the opponent

ALLIANCE

to violate a rule is not in the spirit of FIRST Robotics Competition and not allowed. Rule violations forced in this manner will not result in an assignment of a penalty to the targeted

ALLIANCE

.

Violation: MAJOR FOUL. YELLOW CARD if

REPEATED

.

This rule does not apply for strategies consistent with standard gameplay, for example:

A. a red

ALLIANCE

ROBOT

attempting to climb their

TOWER

in the final 30 seconds of the

MATCH

contacts a blue

ALLIANCE

ROBOT

.

B. a blue

ALLIANCE

ROBOT

is attempting to play defense on a red

ALLIANCE

ROBOT

attempting to score into the

HUB

from within their

ALLIANCE

ZONE and pushes them outside their

ALLIANCE

ZONE.

This rule requires an intentional act with limited or no opportunity for the team being acted on to avoid the penalty such as:

C. forcing an opponent

ROBOT

to catch

FUEL

by pushing them far from (i.e. more than 48.0in (1.22m)) the

HUB

exit to under the

HUB

exit to make them violate G408.

D. a blue

ALLIANCE

ROBOT

, pushing a red

ALLIANCE

ROBOT

far from (i.e. more than 48.0in (1.22m)) the

TOWER

into another red

ALLIANCE

ROBOT

which is in contact with the

TOWER

and the

REFEREE

perceiving that the blue

ROBOT

is deliberately making the red

ROBOT

violate G420.

### [G211 \*Egregious or exceptional violations.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g211-egregious-or-exceptional-violations)

Egregious behavior beyond what is listed in the rules or subsequent violations of any rule or procedure during the event is prohibited.

In addition to rule violations explicitly listed in this manual and witnessed by a

REFEREE

, the Head

REFEREE

may assign a YELLOW or RED CARD for egregious

ROBOT

actions or team member behavior at any time during the event.

Please see section 6.6.1 YELLOW and RED CARDS for additional detail.

Violation: YELLOW or RED CARD.

The intent of this rule is to provide the Head

REFEREES

the flexibility necessary to keep the event running smoothly, as well as keep the safety of all the participants as the highest priority. Behaviors that put the FIRST community or integrity of the game at risk are not allowed and are violations of this rule. Those behaviors include, but are not limited to the list below:

A. inappropriate behavior as outlined in the blue box of G201,

B. jumping over the guardrail,

C. pushing past the

FIELD

reset person blocking an open gate to get on the

FIELD

,

D. reaching into the

FIELD

and grabbing a

ROBOT

during a

MATCH

,

E. a single

PIN

in excess of 15 seconds,

F. exploiting the 3-second window after a

MATCH

described in section 6.5 Scoring to avoid rule violations (e.g. triggering an over-extension that enables

TOWER

points or using a

ROBOT

’S residual energy to impact an opponent

ROBOT

on their

TOWER

),

G. triggering scoring sensors or otherwise interfering with

FMS

or

FIELD

operation,

H. intentionally crossing the CENTER LINE in

AUTO

in order to interfere with an opponent

ROBOT

’S

AUTO

,

I. intentionally ejecting a large quantity of

FUEL

out of the

FIELD

,

J. intentionally exceeding the expansion limits for strategic benefit (i.e. climb the

TOWER

, block part of the

FIELD

, etc.),

K. a HUMAN PLAYER hoarding a large quantity of

FUEL

outside the designated locations in G427,

L. Intentionally scoring a large quantity of

FUEL

into the

HUB

from the NEUTRAL ZONE.

The Head

REFEREE

may assign a YELLOW or RED CARD for a single instance of a rule violation such as the examples given in items above, or for multiple instances of any single rule violation. Teams should be aware that any rule in this manual could escalate to a YELLOW or RED CARD. The Head

REFEREE

has final authority on all rules and violations at an event.

### [G212 \*All teams can play.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g207-dont-abuse-arena-access)

A team may not encourage another team to exclude their

ROBOT

or be

BYPASSED

from a qualification

MATCH

for any reason.

Violation: YELLOW CARD. RED CARD if the

ROBOT

does not participate in the

MATCH

.

## [7.3 Pre-MATCH](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#_73-pre-match)

### [G301 \*Be prompt.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g208-show-up-to-your-qualification-matches)

A DRIVE TEAM member may not cause significant delays to the start of their

MATCH

. Causing a significant delay requires both of the following to be true:

A. The expected

MATCH

start time has passed, and

Event volunteers communicate schedule delays with teams to the best of their ability. The Pit Display (which is typically located near the Pit Administration desk) shows any event timing delay. Announcements on the

FIELD

and in the pits also provide information on delays, and any team uncertain of when to queue for a

MATCH

should communicate with queuing volunteers.

During Qualification

MATCHES

, the expected start time of the

MATCH

is the time indicated on the

MATCH

schedule or the cycle time for current round minus 3 minutes from the end of the previous

MATCH

(which is reflected on the schedule on the Pit Display), whichever is later.

During Playoff

MATCHES

, the expected start time of the

MATCH

is the time indicated on the

MATCH

schedule or 15 minutes from either

ALLIANCE

’S previous

MATCH

, whichever is later.

B. The DRIVE TEAM has access to the

FIELD

and is neither

MATCH

ready nor making a good faith effort, to quickly become

MATCH

ready.

Teams that have violated G208 or have 1 DRIVE TEAM member present and have informed event staff that their

ROBOT

will not be participating in the

MATCH

are considered

MATCH

ready and not in violation of this rule.

Violation: If a Qualification

MATCH

, VERBAL WARNING. MAJOR FOUL for the upcoming

MATCH

if a subsequent violation occurs within the tournament phase. If the DRIVE TEAM is not

MATCH

ready within 2 minutes of the VERBAL WARNING/MAJOR FOUL and the Head

REFEREE

perceives no good faith effort by the DRIVE TEAM to quickly become

MATCH

ready,

DISABLED

.

If a Playoff

MATCH

, VERBAL WARNING issued to the

ALLIANCE

. MAJOR FOUL for the

ALLIANCE

’S upcoming

MATCH

if a subsequent violation occurs within the tournament phase. If the

ALLIANCE

is not

MATCH

ready within 2 minutes of the VERBAL WARNING/MAJOR FOUL having been issued to all 3 teams and the Head

REFEREE

perceives no good faith effort by the DRIVE TEAM(s) to quickly become

MATCH

ready, the offending team’s

ROBOT

is

DISABLED

.

The intent of this rule is to provide an equitable amount of time for both

ALLIANCES

to prepare for each

MATCH

and give DRIVE TEAMS grace given extenuating circumstances that cause them to be late.

Once a VERBAL WARNING /MAJOR FOUL is issued, the Head

REFEREE

starts a 2-minute timer and makes a good faith effort to share the timer’s status with the delaying DRIVE TEAM.

Being “

MATCH

ready” requires that the

ROBOT

is on the

FIELD

, in its STARTING CONFIGURATION, and turned on. Additionally, the DRIVE TEAM members must be in their starting positions.

In general, good faith efforts to quickly become

MATCH

ready are entirely for the purposes of transitioning the

ROBOT

into a

MATCH

ready state (i.e. not attempts to significantly alter a

ROBOT

’s capabilities.) Examples of good faith efforts to quickly become

MATCH

ready include but are not limited to:

A. walking safely towards the

FIELD

with a

ROBOT

that a team is not actively modifying,

B. applying quick fixes such as tape or cable ties to make the

ROBOT

compliant with STARTING CONFIGURATION requirements,

C. waiting for an OPERATOR CONSOLE computer to boot, and

D. working with

FIELD

STAFF to get the

ROBOT

connected to the

FIELD

.

Examples that are not considered good faith efforts to quickly become

MATCH

ready include but are not limited to:

E. a

ROBOT

not moving to the

FIELD

,

F. a

ROBOT

moving to the

FIELD

but being actively modified while doing so,

G. a DRIVE TEAM member remaining on the

FIELD

once a

MATCH

is ready to begin (indicated by the green LEDs having turned off),

H. installing

BUMPERS

, charging pneumatic systems, or any other

ROBOT

maintenance not considered a quick fix as described in item B above once on the

FIELD

,

I. time-consuming use of alignment devices that are external to the

ROBOT

(e.g. a DRIVE TEAM could bring and use a measuring tape, as long as there is no delay to the

MATCH

by doing so), and

J. repairs more substantial than those described in B.

There are no rules that prohibit use of hand tools (including battery operated tools) while setting up

ROBOTS

from the

FIELD

, provided they do not cause significant delay or cause safety concerns.

### [G302 \*Limit what you use during a \ \ MATCH\ \ .](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g211-egregious-or-exceptional-violations)

Items used during a

match

must fit on your team’s

DRIVER

STATION shelf, be worn or held by members from your DRIVE TEAM, or be an item used as an accommodation (e.g. stools, crutches, etc.). Regardless of if the equipment fits the criteria above, it may not:

A. be employed in a way that introduces a safety hazard,

B. extend more than 78.0in (1.981m) above the floor,

C. communicate with anything or anyone outside of the

ARENA

with the exception of medically required equipment,

D. block visibility for

FIELD

STAFF or audience members, or

E. jam or interfere with the remote sensing capabilities of another team or the

FIELD

.

Violation:

MATCH

will not start until the situation is remedied. If discovered or used inappropriately during a

MATCH

, YELLOW CARD.

Examples of equipment that may be considered a safety hazard in the confined space of the

ALLIANCE

AREA include, but are not limited to, a folding step stool, ladder, or a large signaling device.

Using an item that has wireless communications

disabled

complies with C above.

Examples of jamming or interfering with remote sensing capabilities include, but are not limited to, mimicking the

FIELD

AprilTags and shining bright lighting or laser pointers onto the

FIELD

.

### [G303 \*Start your \ \ ROBOTS\ \ .](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g303-start-your-robots)

A

ROBOT

must meet all following MATCH-start requirements:

A. it does not pose a hazard to humans,

FIELD

elements, or other

ROBOTS

,

B. has passed initial, complete inspection, i.e. it’s compliant with all

ROBOT

rules (for exceptions regarding Practice

MATCHES

, see section 9 Inspection & Eligibility (I),

C. if modified after initial Inspection, it’s compliant with I104,

D. its

BUMPERS

overlap their

ROBOT

STARTING LINE,

E. it’s not contacting the

BUMP

,

F. it’s the only team-provided item left on the

FIELD

,

G. it’s not attached to, entangled with, or suspended from any

FIELD

element,

H. it’s confined to its STARTING CONFIGURATION (reference R102 and R104), and

I. it fully and solely supports not more than 8

FUEL

(as described in section 6.3.4 SCORING ELEMENTS).

Violation: If fix is a quick remedy, the

MATCH

won’t start until all requirements are met. If it is not a quick remedy,

DISABLED

and, at the discretion of the Head

REFEREE

, must be re-inspected. If a

ROBOT

not compliant with part B or C participates, its team receives a RED CARD.

If a

ROBOT

is

BYPASSED

prior to the start of the

MATCH

, the DRIVE TEAM may not remove the

ROBOT

from the

FIELD

without permission from the Head

REFEREE

or the

FTA

.

For assessment of many of the items listed above, the Head

REFEREE

is likely to consult with the

LRI

.

## [7.4 In-MATCH](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#_74-in-match)

Rules in this section pertain to game play once a

MATCH

begins.

### [7.4.1 \ \ AUTO](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#_741-auto)

The

AUTO

period is the first 20 seconds of the

MATCH

, and the

FMS

blocks any

DRIVER

control

, so

ROBOTS

operate with only their pre-programmed instructions. Rules in this section apply only during the

AUTO

period.

### [G401 \*Behind the lines.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g401-behind-the-lines)

In

AUTO

, each DRIVE TEAM member must remain in their staged areas. A DRIVE TEAM member staged behind a HUMAN STARTING LINE may not contact anything in front of that HUMAN STARTING LINE, unless for personal or equipment safety, to press the E-Stop or A-Stop, or granted permission by a Head

REFEREE

or

FTA

.

Violation: MINOR FOUL regardless of the number of items contacted.

Pointing, gesturing, or otherwise extending across the HUMAN STARTING LINE such that contact is not made with carpet or other

ARENA

elements is not a violation of this rule.

An example of an exception for equipment safety is if an OPERATOR CONSOLE starts to fall from, or has already fallen off of, the

DRIVER

STATION shelf. In that circumstance, DRIVE TEAM members may step forward to catch it or pick it up off the ground and return it to the shelf.

### [G402 \*Let the \ \ ROBOT\ \  do its thing.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g402-let-the-robot-do-its-thing)

In

AUTO

, a DRIVE TEAM member may not directly or indirectly interact with a

ROBOT

or an OPERATOR CONSOLE unless for personal safety, OPERATOR CONSOLE safety, or pressing an E-Stop or A-Stop. A HUMAN PLAYER entering

FUEL

onto the

FIELD

is an exception to this rule.

Violation: MINOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD.

### [G403 Limited \ \ AUTO\ \  opponent interaction.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g403-limited-auto-opponent-interaction)

In

AUTO

, a

ROBOT

whose

BUMPERS

are completely across the CENTER LINE (i.e. to the opposite side of the CENTER LINE from its

ROBOT

STARTING LINE) may not contact an opponent

ROBOT

ROBOT

and the Head

REFEREE

determines that further damage is likely to occur,

DISABLED

. Corrective action (such as eliminating sharp edges, removing the damaging

MECHANISM

, and/or re-inspection) may be required before the

ROBOT

may compete in subsequent

MATCHES

.

SCORING ELEMENTS are expected to undergo a reasonable amount of wear and tear as they are handled by

ROBOTS

, such as scratching or marking. Routinely gouging, tearing off pieces, or marking SCORING ELEMENTS are violations of this rule.

### [G407 Only score while in your \ \ ALLIANCE\ \  ZONE.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g407-only-score-while-in-your-alliance-zone)

Examples of interaction with a SCORING ELEMENT that are not “

CONTROL

” include, but are not limited to:

A. “bulldozing” (inadvertent contact with a SCORING ELEMENT while in the path of the

ROBOT

moving about the

FIELD

),

B. “deflecting” (being hit by a SCORING ELEMENT that bounces off a

ROBOT

and moves in a random direction.)

Examples of interaction which would be considered strategic include, but are not limited to:

C. intentionally sitting under the

HUB

to collect a large quantity of

FUEL

,

D. intentionally sitting under the

HUB

in order to redirect

FUEL

into your

ALLIANCE

ZONE.

### [G409 \*\ \ ROBOTS\ \  must be safe.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g409-robots-must-be-safe)

A

ROBOT

may not pose an undue hazard to a human, an

ARENA

element, or another

ROBOT

in the following ways:

A. the

ROBOT

or anything it

CONTROLS

, e.g.

FUEL

BUMPER

ZONE (see R405) REPEATEDLY or for more than a

MOMENTARY

amount of time, or

F. its operation or design is dangerous or unsafe.

Violation:

DISABLED

. Corrective action (such as repair of

BUMPERS

, removing the unsafe

MECHANISM

, and/or re-inspection) may be required before the

ROBOT

will be allowed to compete in subsequent

MATCHES

.

Examples of dangerous operation or designs that likely pose undue hazards include, but are not limited to:

A. uncontrolled motion that cannot be stopped by the DRIVE TEAM,

B.

ROBOT

parts “flailing” outside of the

FIELD

,

C.

ROBOTS

dragging their battery, and

D.

ROBOTS

that consistently extend outside the

### [G410 \*Keep your \ \ BUMPERS\ \  low.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g302-limit-what-you-use-during-a-match)

ROBOT

extensions may not interact with the carpet,

BUMPS

, or

TOWER

BASE such that the

BUMPERS

are lifted out of the

BUMPER

ZONE (see R405).

Violation: MINOR FOUL. Corrective action (such as removing the offending

MECHANISM

, and/or re-inspection) may be required before the

ROBOT

will be allowed to compete in subsequent

MATCHES

.

### [G411 Don’t damage the \ \ FIELD\ \ .](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g411-dont-damage-the-field)

A

ROBOT

may not damage

FIELD

elements.

Violation: VERBAL WARNING. If the Head

REFEREE

infers that additional damage is likely,

DISABLED

. YELLOW CARD for any subsequent damage during the event.

Corrective action (such as eliminating sharp edges, removing the damaging

MECHANISM

, and/or re-inspection) may be required before the

ROBOT

will be allowed to compete in subsequent

MATCHES

.

### [G412 Watch your \ \ FIELD\ \  interaction.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g412-watch-your-field-interaction)

A

ROBOT

is prohibited from the following interactions with

FIELD

elements (with the exception of the

RUNGS

and

UPRIGHTS

):

A. grabbing,

B. grasping,

C. attaching to (including the use of a vacuum or hook fastener to anchor to the

FIELD

carpet),

D. becoming entangled with, and

E. suspending from.

Violation: MAJOR FOUL, plus YELLOW CARD if

REPEATED

, or longer than

MOMENTARY

. If the Head

REFEREE

infers that damage is likely,

DISABLED

. Corrective action (such as removing the offending

MECHANISM

, and/or re-inspection) may be required before the

ROBOT

will be allowed to compete in subsequent

MATCHES

.

### [G413 Expansion limits.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g413-expansion-limits)

A

ROBOT

may not extend beyond any of the horizontal or vertical expansion limits described in R105, R106, and R107.

If the over-expansion is due to damage and not used for strategic benefit, it is an exception to this rule, and no penalty is imposed.

Violation: MINOR FOUL, or MAJOR FOUL if the over-expansion is used for strategic benefit, including if it impedes or enables a scoring action. Corrective action (such as removing the offending

MECHANISM

, and/or re-inspection) may be required before the

ROBOT

will be allowed to compete in subsequent

MATCHES

.

The intent of the exception to this rule is to prevent piling on a punitive response to a

ROBOT

that’s already experienced hardship and not leveraging that hardship for gain. Examples for this rule include the following:

A. a physical device on a team’s

ROBOT

, whose purpose is to restrain their

TOWER

mechanism

from extending beyond the limit, breaks after a collision with another

ROBOT

. Provided the

ROBOT

does not use the now-too-long extension to climb the

TOWER

, no violation is assigned.

B. a vertical structural member of a

ROBOT

breaks at the bottom and rotates out such that it exceeds the limit imposed. The

ROBOT

then parks such that its extension blocks opponent

ROBOTS

from reaching the

OUTPOST

. A MAJOR FOUL is issued.

### [G414 Don’t Climb on each other.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g414-dont-climb-on-each-other)

ROBOTS

may not fully support the weight of other

ROBOTS

on their

ALLIANCE

to climb the

TOWER

.

Violation: Supported

ROBOTS

become ineligible for

TOWER

points for the remainder of the

MATCH

.

### [7.4.4 Opponent Interaction](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#_744-opponent-interaction)

Note, G415, G416, G417 are mutually exclusive. A single

ROBOT

to

ROBOT

interaction which violates more than 1 of these rules results in the most punitive penalty, and only the most punitive penalty, being assessed.

### [G415 \*Stay out of other \ \ ROBOTS\ \ .](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g303-start-your-robots)

A

ROBOT

may not use a

COMPONENT

outside its

ROBOT

PERIMETER (except its

BUMPERS

) to initiate contact with an opponent

ROBOT

inside the vertical projection of the opponent’s

ROBOT

PERIMETER.

Violation: MINOR FOUL.

For the purposes of this rule, “initiate contact” requires movement towards an opponent

ROBOT

.

In a collision, it’s possible for both

ROBOTS

to initiate contact.

### [G416 \*This isn’t combat robotics.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g416-this-isnt-combat-robotics)

A

ROBOT

may not damage or functionally impair an opponent

ROBOT

in either of the following ways:

A. deliberately.

B. regardless of intent, by initiating contact, either directly or transitively via a SCORING ELEMENT CONTROLLED by the

ROBOT

, inside the vertical projection of an opponent’s

ROBOT

PERIMETER.

Damage or functional impairment because of contact with a tipped-over opponent

ROBOT

, which is not perceived by a

REFEREE

to be deliberate, is not a violation of this rule.

Violation: MAJOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD, or if opponent

ROBOT

is unable to drive, then MAJOR FOUL and RED CARD.

FIRST Robotics Competition can be a full-contact competition and may include rigorous game play. While this rule aims to limit severe damage to

ROBOTS

, teams should design their

ROBOTS

to be robust.

Examples of violations of this rule include, but are not limited to:

A. A

ROBOT

leaves an arm extended, spins around to change course, and unintentionally hits and damages a

COMPONENT

inside the

ROBOT

PERIMETER of a nearby opponent

ROBOT

.

B. A

ROBOT

, in the process of trying to quickly reverse direction, tips up on a single pair of wheels, lands atop an opponent

ROBOT

, and damages a

COMPONENT

inside that opponent’s

ROBOT

PERIMETER.

C. A

ROBOT

high-speed rams and/or REPEATEDLY smashes an opponent

ROBOT

and causes damage. The

REFEREE

infers that the

ROBOT

was deliberately trying to damage the opponent’s

ROBOT

.

Examples of functionally impairing another

ROBOT

include, but are not limited to:

D. opening an opponent’s relief valve such that the opponent’s air pressure drops and

E. powering off an opponent’s

ROBOT

(this example also clearly results in a RED CARD because the

ROBOT

is no longer able to drive).

At the conclusion of the

MATCH

, the Head

REFEREE

may elect to visually inspect a

ROBOT

to confirm violations of this rule made during a

MATCH

and remove the violation if the damage cannot be verified.

For the purposes of this rule, “initiating contact” requires movement towards an opponent

ROBOT

.

In a collision, it’s possible for both

ROBOTS

to initiate contact.

"Unable to drive" means that because of the incident, the

DRIVER

can no longer drive to a desired location in a reasonable time (generally). For example, if a

ROBOT

can only move in circles, or can only move extremely slowly, the

ROBOT

is considered unable to drive.

### [G417 \*Don’t tip or entangle.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g417-dont-tip-or-entangle)

A

ROBOT

may not deliberately, attach to, tip, or entangle with an opponent

ROBOT

.

Violation: MAJOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD, or if

CONTINUOUS

or opponent

ROBOT

is unable to drive, then MAJOR FOUL and RED CARD.

Examples of violations of this rule include, but are not limited to:

A. using a wedge-like

MECHANISM

to tip over opponent

ROBOTS

,

B. making BUMPER-to-BUMPER contact with an opponent

ROBOT

that is attempting to right itself after previously falling over and causing them to fall over again, and

C. causing an opponent

ROBOT

to tip over by contacting the

ROBOT

after it starts to tip if, in the judgement of the

REFEREE

, that contact could have been avoided.

Tipping as an unintended consequence of normal

ROBOT

to

ROBOT

interaction, including single

BUMPER

to

BUMPER

hits that result in a

ROBOT

tipping, is not a violation of this rule.

"Unable to drive" means that because of the incident, the

DRIVER

can no longer drive to a desired location in a reasonable time (generally). For example, if a

ROBOT

can only move in circles, or can only move extremely slowly, the

ROBOT

is considered unable to drive.

### [G418 \*There’s a 3-count on \ \ PINS\ \ .](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g418-theres-a-3-count-on-pins)

A

ROBOT

may not

PIN

an opponent’s

ROBOT

for more than 3 seconds. A

ROBOT

is PINNING if it is preventing the movement of an opponent

ROBOT

by contact, either direct or transitive (such as against a

FIELD

element). A

PIN

count ends once any of the following criteria below are met:

A. the

ROBOTS

have separated by at least 72.0in (1.83m) from each other for more than 3 seconds,

B. either

ROBOT

has moved 72.0in (1.83m) from where the

PIN

initiated for more than 3 seconds, or

C. the PINNING

ROBOT

gets PINNED.

For criteria A, the

PIN

count pauses once

ROBOTS

are separated by 72.0in (1.83m) until either the

PIN

ends or the PINNING

ROBOT

moves back within 72.0in (1.83m), at which point the

PIN

count is resumed.

For criteria B, the

PIN

count pauses once either

ROBOT

has moved 72.0in (1.83m) from where the

PIN

initiated until the

PIN

ends or until both

ROBOTS

move back within 72.0in (1.83m), at which point the

PIN

count is resumed.

Violation: MINOR FOUL, and for every 3 seconds in which the situation is not corrected, a MAJOR FOUL is assessed.

A team’s desired direction of travel is not a consideration when determining if a

ROBOT

is PINNED.

### [G419 \*Don’t collude with your partners to shut down major parts of game play.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g419-dont-collude-with-your-partners-to-shut-down-major-parts-of-game-play)

2 or more

ROBOTS

that appear to a

REFEREE

to be working together may not isolate or close off any major element of

MATCH

play.

Violation: MAJOR FOUL, and for every 3 seconds in which the situation is not corrected, a MAJOR FOUL is assessed.

Examples of violations of this rule include, but are not limited to:

A. shutting down access to all SCORING ELEMENTS,

B. quarantining all opponents to a small area of the

FIELD

,

C. preventing access to the opponent’s

TOWER

,

D. preventing access to a

field

zone by blocking both

TRENCHES

, and

E. preventing access to a

field

zone by blocking both

BUMPS

.

Examples of standard gameplay that are not violations, include, but are not limited to:

F. A single

ROBOT

blocking access to a particular area of the

FIELD

, and

G. 2

ROBOTS

independently collecting SCORING ELEMENTS in front of a

BUMP

or

TRENCH

at the same time.

### [G420 \ \ TOWER\ \  protection.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g420-tower-protection)

A

ROBOT

may not contact, directly or transitively through a SCORING ELEMENT, an opponent

ROBOT

in contact with an opponent

TOWER

during the last 30 seconds of the

MATCH

regardless of who initiates contact.

Violation: MAJOR FOUL and if the opponent

ROBOT

is off the ground the opponent

ROBOT

is awarded

LEVEL

3

TOWER

points.

Transitive contact requires that each

robot

is contacting the same SCORING ELEMENT(S) simultaneously.

### [7.4.5 Human](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#_745-human)

### [G421 \*No wandering.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g421-no-wandering)

A DRIVE TEAM member must remain in their designated area as follows:

A.

DRIVERS

and DRIVE COACHES may not contact anything outside their

ALLIANCE

AREA,

B. a

DRIVER

must use the OPERATOR CONSOLE in the

DRIVER

STATION to which they are assigned, as indicated on the team sign,

C. a HUMAN PLAYER may not contact anything outside their

ALLIANCE

AREA, and

D. a

TECHNICIAN

may not contact anything outside their designated area.

Exceptions are granted as follows:

E. for a HUMAN PLAYER partially outside the

ALLIANCE

AREA,

F. in cases concerning safety, and

G. for actions that are inadvertent,

MOMENTARY

, and inconsequential.

Violation: MINOR FOUL.

An intent of item B is to prevent unsafe situations where long tethers to OPERATOR CONSOLE devices increase tripping hazards as the operator moves about the

ALLIANCE

AREA. In the interest of avoiding nuisance penalties associated with a DRIVE TEAM member stepping outside of a prescribed area, we prefer to offer a general guideline as to what it means to use the OPERATOR CONSOLE in the

ALLIANCE

AREA. Provided the DRIVE TEAM member is within close proximity of their

DRIVER

STATION, there will be no repercussions. However, a DRIVE TEAM member located more than approximately half a

DRIVER

STATION width away from their own

DRIVER

STATION while using their OPERATOR CONSOLE is likely violating this rule.

### [G422 \*DRIVE COACHES and other teams: hands off the \ \ controls\ \ .](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g422-drive-coaches-and-other-teams-hands-off-the-controls)

A

ROBOT

shall be operated only by the

DRIVERS

and/or HUMAN PLAYERS of that team. A DRIVE COACH activating their E-Stop or A-Stop is the exception to this rule.

Violation: MAJOR FOUL. RED CARD if greater-than-MOMENTARY.

Exceptions may be made before a

MATCH

for major conflicts, e.g. religious holidays, major testing, transportations issues, etc.

### [G423 \*DRIVE TEAMS, watch your reach.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g423-drive-teams-watch-your-reach)

A DRIVE TEAM member may not extend:

A. into the

CHUTE

beyond the ALLIANCE-colored tape line while the

CHUTE

DOOR is open, or

B. into the

CORRAL

beyond the ALLIANCE-colored tape line.

Violation: MINOR FOUL.

Teams should be careful when placing or collecting SCORING ELEMENTS and be aware of G101.

### [G424 \*Humans: use SCORING ELEMENTS as directed.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g424-humans-use-scoring-elements-as-directed)

A DRIVE TEAM member may not deliberately use a SCORING ELEMENT in an attempt to ease or amplify a challenge associated with a

FIELD

element.

Violation: MAJOR FOUL.

An example of a violation of this rule is if a HUMAN PLAYER uses a

FUEL

to disrupt an opponent

ROBOT

attempting to climb on the

TOWER

.

### [G425 \*SCORING ELEMENT delivery.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g425-scoring-element-delivery)

FUEL

may only be introduced to the

FIELD

by a HUMAN PLAYER or

DRIVER

in the following ways:

A. through the

CHUTE

,

B. through the bottom opening in the

OUTPOST

, or

C. thrown from the

OUTPOST

AREA.

Violation: MAJOR FOUL.

### [G426 \*DRIVE COACHES, SCORING ELEMENTS are off limits.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g426-drive-coaches-scoring-elements-are-off-limits)

DRIVE COACHES may not touch SCORING ELEMENTS, unless for safety purposes.

Violation: MINOR FOUL.

### [G427 The \ \ OUTPOST\ \  has a storage limit.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g427-the-outpost-has-a-storage-limit)

Off-FIELD

FUEL

may only be stored in the

CHUTE

and the

CORRAL

. Excess

FUEL

, defined as the

CHUTE

&

CORRAL

being full, must immediately be entered onto the

FIELD

.

HUMAN PLAYERS making a good-faith effort to immediately move or enter additional

FUEL

is an exception to this rule.

Violation: MINOR FOUL, and if

CONTINUOUS

, a MAJOR FOUL is assessed.

## [7.5 Post-MATCH](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#_75-post-match)

### [G501 \*Leave promptly.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-rules-(g)\#g501-leave-promptly)

A DRIVE TEAM member may not cause significant or multiple delays to the start of a subsequent

MATCH

, scheduled break content, or other

FIELD

activities.

Violation: VERBAL WARNING. YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations at any point during the event.
