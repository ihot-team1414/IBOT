# 6 Game Details

_Figure 6‑1 REBUILT_

![image](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2026/Manual/HTML/2026GameManual_files/image042.png)

In REBUILT, 2

ALLIANCES

(an

ALLIANCE

is a cooperative of up to 4 FIRST Robotics Competition teams) play

MATCHES

, set up and implemented per the details described below.

## [6.1 \ \ MATCH\ \  Overview](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-details\#_61-match-overview)

MATCHES

run on 7–10-minute cycles, which consist of pre-MATCH setup, the 2-minute and 40-second

MATCH

, and the post-MATCH reset.

During the

MATCH

,

ROBOTS

collect

FUEL

and score in their

HUB

. HUMAN PLAYERS can deliver

FUEL

to

ROBOTS

or score them in their

HUB

.

ROBOTS

conclude the

MATCH

climbing on their

TOWER

.

## [6.2 DRIVE TEAM](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-details\#_62-drive-team)

A DRIVE TEAM is a set of up to 5 people from the same FIRST Robotics Competition team responsible for team performance for a specific

MATCH

. There are 4 specific roles on a DRIVE TEAM which

ALLIANCES

can use to assist

ROBOTS

, and no more than 1 member of the DRIVE TEAM may be a non-STUDENT.

The intent of the definition of DRIVE TEAM and DRIVE TEAM related rules is that, barring extenuating circumstances, the DRIVE TEAM consists of people who arrived at the event affiliated with that team and are responsible for their team’s and

ROBOT

’S performance at the event (this means a person may be affiliated with more than 1 team).

The intent is not to allow teams to “adopt” members of other teams for strategic advantage for the loaning team, borrowing team, and/or their

ALLIANCE

(e.g. an

ALLIANCE

CAPTAIN believes 1 of their

DRIVERS

has more experience than a

DRIVER

on their first pick, and the teams agree the first pick team will “adopt” that

DRIVER

and make them a member of their DRIVE TEAM for Playoffs).

The definition isn’t stricter for 2 main reasons. First, to avoid additional bureaucratic burden on teams and event volunteers (e.g. requiring that teams submit official rosters that Queuing must check before allowing a DRIVE TEAM into the

ARENA

). Second, to provide space for exceptional circumstances that give teams the opportunity to display Gracious Professionalism (e.g. a bus is delayed, a DRIVE COACH has no

DRIVERS

, and their pit neighbors agree to help by loaning

DRIVERS

as temporary members of the team until their bus arrives).

_Table 6‑1 DRIVE TEAM roles_

| Role | Description | Max./ DRIVE TEAM | Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DRIVE COACH | a guide or advisor | 1 | any team member, must wear “DRIVE COACH” button |
| TECHNICIAN | a resource for <br>ROBOT<br> troubleshooting, setup, and removal from the <br>FIELD | 1 | any team member, must wear “<br>TECHNICIAN<br>” button |
| DRIVER | an operator and controller of the <br>ROBOT | 3 | STUDENT<br>, must wear a “DRIVE TEAM” button |
| HUMAN PLAYER | a SCORING ELEMENT manager | 3 | STUDENT<br>, must wear a “DRIVE TEAM” button |

A

STUDENT

is a person who has not completed high-school, secondary school, or the comparable

level

as of September 1 prior to Kickoff.

The

TECHNICIAN

provides teams with a technical resource for pre-MATCH setup,

ROBOT

connectivity, OPERATOR CONSOLE troubleshooting, and post-MATCH removal of the

ROBOT

. Some pre-MATCH responsibilities for the

TECHNICIAN

may include, but are not limited to:

- location of the


ROBOT


radio, its power connection, and understanding of its indicator lights
- location of the roboRIO and understanding of its indicator lights
- username and password for the OPERATOR CONSOLE
- restarting the


Driver


Station and Dashboard software on the OPERATOR CONSOLE
- changing the bandwidth utilization (e.g. camera resolution, frame rate, etc.)
- changing a battery
- charging pneumatics

While the

TECHNICIAN

may be the primary technical member of the DRIVE TEAM, all members of the DRIVE TEAM are encouraged to have knowledge of the basic functionality of the

ROBOT

, such as the location and operation of the main circuit breaker, connecting and resetting joysticks or gamepads from the OPERATOR CONSOLE, and removing the

ROBOT

from the

FIELD

.

Per Table 6‑1, each team is allotted up to 3

STUDENTS

who may be assigned as

DRIVERS

or HUMAN PLAYERS. If multiple teams on an

ALLIANCE

do not have 3

STUDENTS

at the event to act in these roles, 1 of the

ALLIANCE

’S teams may substitute a

STUDENT

TECHNICIAN

as a HUMAN PLAYER for that

MATCH

only. In this case,

- the Head


REFEREE


must be notified,
- all HUMAN PLAYER rules now apply to this DRIVE TEAM member, and
- this DRIVE TEAM member is no longer considered a


TECHNICIAN


for that


MATCH


.

## [6.3 Setup](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-details\#_63-setup)

Before each

MATCH

begins,

FIELD

STAFF stage SCORING ELEMENTS as described in section 6.3.4 SCORING ELEMENTS. DRIVE TEAMS stage their

ROBOTS

(as described in section 6.3.3

ROBOTS

) and OPERATOR CONSOLES (as described in section 6.3.2 OPERATOR CONSOLES). Then, DRIVE TEAMS take their places as described in section 6.3.1 DRIVE TEAMS.

### [6.3.1 DRIVE TEAMS](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-details\#_631-drive-teams)

DRIVE TEAMS prepare for a

MATCH

by staging in the appropriate areas, according to their role on the DRIVE TEAM, and by identifying themselves accordingly. DRIVE TEAM starting conditions are listed below, and a DRIVE TEAM obstructing or delaying any of the conditions is at risk of violating G301.

- A. only DRIVE TEAM members assigned to the upcoming


MATCH


are present,
- B. for Qualification


MATCHES


only DRIVE TEAM members whose


ROBOTS


have passed initial, complete Inspection are present,
- C. any number of HUMAN PLAYERS are staged in their


OUTPOST


AREAS,
- D. HUMAN PLAYERS not included in C,


DRIVERS


, and DRIVE COACHES are in their


ALLIANCE


AREA and behind the HUMAN STARTING LINE,
- E.


TECHNICIANS


are in the event-designated area near the


FIELD


,
- F. DRIVE TEAM members clearly display their designated buttons above their waists (DRIVE COACH - “Drive Coach”,


DRIVERS


and HUMAN PLAYERS - “Drive Team”, and


TECHNICIAN


\- “


Technician


”), and
- G. if a Playoff


MATCH


, the


ALLIANCE


CAPTAIN clearly displays their designated


ALLIANCE


CAPTAIN identifier (e.g. hat or armband).

### [6.3.2 OPERATOR CONSOLES](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-details\#_632-operator-consoles)

DRIVE TEAMS set up their OPERATOR CONSOLE as soon as the DRIVE TEAM from the previous

MATCH

has cleared the area. OPERATOR CONSOLES must be compliant with all relevant rules, specifically those in section 8.9 OPERATOR CONSOLE. The OPERATOR CONSOLE is plugged into the team’s assigned

DRIVER

STATION, as indicated on the team sign. Any

control

devices worn or held by their HUMAN PLAYERS and/or

DRIVERS

during the

MATCH

must be disconnected from or set on or beside the OPERATOR CONSOLE before the

MATCH

can begin. A DRIVE TEAM obstructing or delaying OPERATOR CONSOLE setup is at risk of violating G301.

For the purposes of FIRST Robotics Competition, any device connected to the OPERATOR CONSOLE is considered a

control

device because

REFEREES

are not expected to differentiate between devices that can or cannot

control

the

ROBOT

.

### [6.3.3 \ \ ROBOTS](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-details\#_633-robots)

DRIVE TEAMS stage their

ROBOT

in accordance with G303. A DRIVE TEAM obstructing or delaying

ROBOT

setup requirements is at risk of violating G301.

If order of placement matters to either or both

ALLIANCES

, the

ALLIANCE

notifies the Head

REFEREE

during setup for that

MATCH

, and the Head

REFEREE

instructs

ALLIANCES

to alternate placement of

ROBOTS

. In a Qualification

MATCH

,

REFEREE

instructions are that

ROBOTS

are placed in the following order:

- red


DRIVER


STATION 1


ROBOT

- blue


DRIVER


STATION 1


ROBOT

- red


DRIVER


STATION 2


ROBOT

- blue


DRIVER


STATION 2


ROBOT

- red


DRIVER


STATION 3


ROBOT

- blue


DRIVER


STATION 3


ROBOT


In an intra-Division Playoff

MATCH

, the same pattern is applied, but instead of blue

ALLIANCE

placing last, the higher seeded

ALLIANCE

(regardless of color) places last. For inter-Division Playoff

MATCHES

, the

ALLIANCE

that places last is determined by a (real or virtual) coin flip facilitated by the Head

REFEREE

where a “heads” result invites the red

ALLIANCE

to place last.

FIELD

STAFF may ask teams to indicate their intended location and are not required to wait for a team to stage their

ROBOT

in its exact location before moving to the next team.

### [6.3.4 SCORING ELEMENTS](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-details\#_634-scoring-elements)

Before each

MATCH

begins,

FIELD

STAFF stage SCORING ELEMENTS.

_Figure 6‑2 SCORING ELEMENT staging positions_

![image](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2026/Manual/HTML/2026GameManual_files/image043.png)

504

FUEL

are staged for each

MATCH

as follows (reference Figure 6‑2):

- A. 24


FUEL


are staged in each


DEPOT


(


FUEL


may not be in a uniform layout),
- B. 24


FUEL


are staged in each


OUTPOST





CHUTE


,
- C. 8


FUEL


may be preloaded in each


ROBOT


by the


ROBOT


’S DRIVE TEAM, such that each


FUEL


is fully supported by the


ROBOT


(up to 48 total; a


FUEL


not pre-loaded in a


ROBOT


is staged in the NEUTRAL ZONE), and
- D. remaining


FUEL


are arranged in the NEUTRAL ZONE through a process listed in Section 6.3.4.1 (360 to 408, depending on how many are preloaded in


ROBOTS


).

Due to the high number of SCORING ELEMENTS in REBUILT,

FIELD

STAFF may not be able to perfectly count all

FUEL

put into the NEUTRAL ZONE. The number of

FUEL

staged in the NEUTRAL ZONE for any given

match

may fluctuate around +/- 24

FUEL

.

For District Championship and/or FIRST Championship events, the quantity of

FUEL

staged in a

MATCH

may increase up to 600. If this happens, the additional

FUEL

will be included as part of an updated

FUEL

arrangement in the NEUTRAL ZONE.

#### [6.3.4.1 NEUTRAL ZONE \ \ FUEL\ \  ARRANGEMENT](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-details\#_6341-neutral-zone-fuel-arrangement)

The NEUTRAL ZONE is staged by the

FIELD

crew by corralling all

FUEL

within a bounding box that is approximately 206.0in (5.23m) wide and 72.0in (1.83m) deep. The bounding box has a solid divider in the middle that is 2.0in (5.08cm) wide that will result in a small gap in

FUEL

. The dividers will be removed prior to the start of the

MATCH

.

_Figure 6‑3 NEUTRAL ZONE_

_FUEL_

_setup_

![image](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2026/Manual/HTML/2026GameManual_files/image044.png)

The expected result of the dispersal is a roughly equal split of

FUEL

on both sides of the CENTER LINE. The dispersal between the scoring table side and non-scoring table side of the

field

is expected to vary

match

to

match

.

The placement of

FUEL

in the NEUTRAL ZONE is not intended to be in a perfect grid. Teams should expect variances in the placement of

FUEL

in the NEUTRAL ZONE at the start of the

MATCH

.

## [6.4 \ \ MATCH\ \  Periods](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-details\#_64-match-periods)

The first period of each

MATCH

is 20 seconds long and called the Autonomous Period (

AUTO

). During

AUTO

,

ROBOTS

operate without any DRIVE TEAM

control

or input.

ROBOTS

score SCORING ELEMENTS, may leave their

ROBOT

STARTING LINE and retrieve additional SCORING ELEMENTS, and may climb their

TOWER

. There is a 3-second delay between

AUTO

and

TELEOP

for scoring purposes as described in section 6.5 Scoring.

The second period of each

MATCH

is the remaining 2 minutes and 20 seconds (2:20) and called the Teleoperated Period (

TELEOP

). During

TELEOP

,

DRIVERS

remotely operate

ROBOTS

to retrieve and score SCORING ELEMENTS and climb their

TOWER

.

TELEOP

is split into further segments: the TRANSITION

SHIFT

, the

ALLIANCE

SHIFTS

, and END GAME. There are four

ALLIANCE

SHIFTS

named

SHIFT

1,

SHIFT

2,

SHIFT

3, and

SHIFT

4\. The duration of each timeframe is shown in Table 6‑2.

_Table 6‑2:_

_MATCH_

_SHIFTS_

| MATCH<br> Period | MATCH<br> Timeframe | Duration | Timer Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AUTO | AUTO | 20 Seconds | 0:20 – 0:00 |
| TELEOP | TRANSITION <br>SHIFT | 10 Seconds | 2:20 – 2:10 |
| TELEOP | SHIFT<br> 1 | 25 Seconds | 2:10 – 1:45 |
| TELEOP | SHIFT<br> 2 | 25 Seconds | 1:45 – 1:20 |
| TELEOP | SHIFT<br> 3 | 25 Seconds | 1:20 – 0:55 |
| TELEOP | SHIFT<br> 4 | 25 Seconds | 0:55 – 0:30 |
| TELEOP | END GAME | 30 Seconds | 0:30 – 0:00 |

### [6.4.1 \ \ HUB\ \  Status](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-details\#_641-hub-status)

During the

MATCH

, the status of a

HUB

can be either active or inactive.

FUEL

scored in an active

HUB

is worth

MATCH

points but

FUEL

scored in an inactive

HUB

will not earn any points as shown in Table 6‑3. Both

ALLIANCE

HUBS

are active during

AUTO

, the TRANSITION

SHIFT

, and END GAME. During the

ALLIANCE

SHIFTS

, only one

ALLIANCE

HUB

will be active while the other

ALLIANCE

’S

HUB

becomes inactive.

The status of both

HUBS

during the

ALLIANCE

SHIFTS

is based on the results of

AUTO

. The

ALLIANCE

that scores the most

FUEL

during

AUTO

will have their

HUB

set to inactive for

SHIFT

1 while their opponent’s

HUB

will be active, as shown in Table 6‑3.

HUB

statuses will then alternate at the start of each following

ALLIANCE

SHIFT

, until the start of END GAME where both

HUBS

return to active. If both

ALLIANCES

score the same number of

FUEL

during

AUTO

, the

FMS

will randomly select an

ALLIANCE

and use its

HUB

status order for the

ALLIANCE

SHIFTS

during the

MATCH

.

FMS

relays the

ALLIANCE

who scored more

FUEL

during

AUTO

, or the

ALLIANCE

selected by

FMS

, to all OPERATOR CONSOLES simultaneously at the start of

TELEOP

. Specific details on the format of the data can be found on the [2026 FRC \\
\\
Control\\
\\
System website](https://frc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/yearly-overview/2026-Game-Data.html).

_Table 6‑3:_

## [6.5 Scoring](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-details\#_65-scoring)

ALLIANCES

are rewarded for accomplishing various actions throughout a

MATCH

, including scoring

FUEL

, climbing their

TOWER

, and winning or tying

MATCHES

.

Rewards are granted either via

MATCH

points or Ranking Points (often abbreviated to

RP

, which increase the measure used to rank teams in the Qualification Tournament).

All scores are assessed and updated throughout the

MATCH

, except as follows:

- A. assessment of


FUEL


scored in the


HUB


continues for up to 3 seconds after the


ARENA


timer displays 0:00 following


AUTO


.
- B. assessment of


FUEL


scored in the


HUB


continues for up to 3 seconds after the


ARENA


timer displays 0:00 following


TELEOP


.
- C. assessment of


AUTO





TOWER


points is made after the


ARENA


timer displays 0:00 following


AUTO


.
- D. assessment of


TELEOP





TOWER


points is made 3 seconds after the


ARENA


timer displays 0:00 following


TELEOP


, or when all


ROBOTS


have come to rest following the conclusion of the


MATCH


, whichever happens first.

Assessment of

FUEL

scored in the

HUB

continues for 3 seconds after the

HUB

deactivates to account for

FUEL

processing time.

TOWER

points are evaluated and scored by human volunteers. Teams are encouraged to make sure that it is obvious and unambiguous that the criteria are met.

### [6.5.1 SCORING ELEMENT Scoring Criteria](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-details\#_651-scoring-element-scoring-criteria)

A

FUEL

is scored in the

HUB

once it passes through the top opening of the

HUB

and through the sensor array.

### [6.5.2 \ \ ROBOT\ \  Scoring Criteria](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-details\#_652-robot-scoring-criteria)

To qualify for

TOWER

points for a given

LEVEL

, a

## [6.6 Violations](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-details\#_66-violations)

Unless otherwise noted, all violations are assigned for each instance of a rule violation. A description of the penalties is listed in Table 6‑6. All rules throughout the Game Rules section are called as perceived by a

REFEREE

.

_Table 6‑6 Rule violations_

| Penalty | Description |
| --- | --- |

### [6.6.1 YELLOW and RED CARDS](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-details\#_661-yellow-and-red-cards)

In addition to rule violations explicitly listed throughout this document, YELLOW CARDS and RED CARDS are used in FIRST Robotics Competition to address team and

ROBOT

behavior that does not align with the mission, values, and culture of FIRST.

The Head

REFEREE

may assign a YELLOW CARD as a warning, or a RED CARD for egregious behavior inappropriate at a FIRST Robotics Competition event.

If an action resulting in the assignment of a YELLOW or RED CARD is determined to be the result of an

ARENA

FAULT, per section 10.2, the CARD will be rescinded.

A YELLOW or RED CARD is indicated on the audience display

MATCH

results screen. During Qualification

MATCHES

, A YELLOW or RED CARD is indicated next to the team who received the CARD and the Game Announcer describes the violation. During Playoff

MATCHES

, the card is applied to the whole

ALLIANCE

and as such “RED CARD" or "YELLOW CARD" appears above the

ALLIANCE

number.

YELLOW CARDS are additive, meaning that a second YELLOW CARD is automatically converted to a RED CARD. A team is issued a RED CARD for any subsequent incident in which they receive an additional YELLOW CARD, including earning a second YELLOW CARD during a single

MATCH

. A second YELLOW CARD is indicated by the Head

REFEREE

holding a YELLOW CARD and RED CARD in the air simultaneously after the completion of the

MATCH

. A team that has received either a YELLOW CARD or a RED CARD carries a YELLOW CARD into subsequent

MATCHES

, except as noted below.

Once a team receives a YELLOW or RED CARD, a yellow rectangle will show next to the team number on the audience display during subsequent

MATCHES

, including any replays.

_Figure 6‑5 Example audience screen graphic showing YELLOW CARD indicators_

![image](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2026/Manual/HTML/2026GameManual_files/image046.png)

All YELLOW CARDS are cleared in

FMS

at the conclusion of Practice, Qualification, and division Playoff

MATCHES

. VERBAL WARNINGS issued by the head

REFEREE

are cleared after Practice

MATCHES

and persist from Qualification

MATCHES

through subsequent tournament phases.

### [6.6.2 YELLOW and RED CARD application](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-details\#_662-yellow-and-red-card-application)

YELLOW and RED CARDS are applied based on the following:

_Table 6‑7: YELLOW and RED CARD application_

| Time YELLOW or RED CARDS earned: | MATCH<br> to which CARD is applied: |
| --- | --- |
| Prior to Qualification <br>MATCHES | REFEREES<br> may or may not be present during Practice <br>MATCHES<br>. With input from event staff, the Head <br>REFEREE<br> may opt to perpetuate a VERBAL WARNING or YELLOW CARD earned prior to Qualification <br>MATCHES<br> to the first Qualification <br>MATCH<br> for particularly egregious behavior. |
| during the Qualification <br>MATCHES | team’s current (or just-completed) <br>MATCH<br>. In the case where the team participated as a <br>SURROGATE<br> in the current (or just completed) <br>MATCH<br>, the card is applied to the team’s previous <br>MATCH<br> (i.e. the team’s second Qualification <br>MATCH<br>) |
| between the end of Qualification <br>MATCHES<br> and the start of Playoff <br>MATCHES | ALLIANCE<br>’S first Playoff <br>MATCH |
| during the Playoff <br>MATCHES | ALLIANCE<br>’S current (or just-completed) <br>MATCH |

A

MATCH

is no longer the current

MATCH

once the results of the

MATCH

have been posted or the Head

REFEREE

or their designee has indicated that teams can collect their

ROBOTS

, whichever is later.

Please see examples of the application of YELLOW and RED CARDS as shown in section 6.6.4 Violation Details.

### [6.6.3 YELLOW and RED CARDS during Playoff \ \ MATCHES](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-details\#_663-yellow-and-red-cards-during-playoff-matches)

During Playoff

MATCHES

, YELLOW and RED CARDS are assigned to the violating team’s entire

ALLIANCE

instead of to only the violating team. If an

ALLIANCE

receives 2 YELLOW CARDS, the entire

ALLIANCE

is issued a RED CARD which results in DISQUALIFICATION for the associated

MATCH

. If both

ALLIANCES

receive a RED CARD, the

ALLIANCE

assessed the first RED CARD, chronologically, is

DISQUALIFIED

and loses the

MATCH

.

### [6.6.4 Violation Details](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-details\#_664-violation-details)

There are several styles of violation wording used in this manual. Below are some example violations and a clarification of the way the violation would be assessed. The examples shown do not represent all possible violations, but rather a representative set of combinations.

_Table 6‑8 Violation examples_

| Example Violation | Expanded Interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| MINOR FOUL | Upon violation, a MINOR FOUL is assessed against the violating <br>ALLIANCE<br>. |
| MAJOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD | Upon violation, a MAJOR FOUL is assessed against the violating <br>ALLIANCE<br>. After the <br>MATCH<br>, the Head <br>REFEREE<br> presents the violating team with a YELLOW CARD. |
| MINOR FOUL per additional SCORING ELEMENT. If egregious, YELLOW CARD | Upon violation, a number of MINOR FOULS are assessed against the violating <br>ALLIANCE<br> equal to the number of additional SCORING ELEMENTS beyond the permitted quantity. Additionally, if the <br>REFEREES<br> determine that the action was egregious, the Head <br>REFEREE<br> presents the violating team with a YELLOW CARD after the <br>MATCH<br>. |
| MINOR FOUL. MAJOR FOUL IF <br>REPEATED | Upon initial violation in a <br>MATCH<br>, a MINOR FOUL is assessed against the violating <br>ALLIANCE<br>. If the <br>ALLIANCE<br>ROBOT<br> repeats the infraction in the <br>MATCH<br>, a MAJOR FOUL is assessed against the violating <br>ALLIANCE<br>. Assuming no additional infractions of that rule by that <br>ROBOT<br> in that <br>MATCH<br>, the <br>ROBOT<br> has “earned” a MINOR FOUL and a MAJOR FOUL for their <br>ALLIANCE<br>. |
| MAJOR FOUL, and for every 3 seconds in which the situation is not corrected, a MAJOR FOUL is assessed | Upon violation, a MAJOR FOUL is assessed against the violating <br>ALLIANCE<br> and the <br>REFEREE<br> begins to count. Their count continues until the criteria to discontinue the count are met, and for each 3 seconds within that time, an additional MAJOR FOUL is assessed against the violating <br>ALLIANCE<br>. A <br>ROBOT<br> in violation of this type of rule for 15 seconds receives a total of 6 MAJOR FOULS (assuming no other rules were being simultaneously violated). |
| RED CARD for the <br>ALLIANCE | After the <br>MATCH<br>, the Head <br>REFEREE<br> presents the violating <br>ALLIANCE<br> with a RED CARD in the following fashion: · In a PLAYOFF <br>MATCH<br>, a single RED CARD is assessed to the <br>ALLIANCE<br>. · In all other scenarios, each team on the <br>ALLIANCE<br> is issued a RED CARD. |

## [6.7 Head \ \ REFEREE\ \  and \ \ FTA\ \  Interaction](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-details\#_67-head-referee-and-fta-interaction)

The Head

REFEREE

has the ultimate authority in the

ARENA

during the event, but may receive input from additional sources, e.g. Game Designers, FIRST personnel,

FTA

, and other event staff. The Head

REFEREE

rulings are final. No event staff, including the Head

REFEREE

, will review video, photos, artistic renderings, etc. of any

MATCH

, from any source, under any circumstances.

### [6.7.1 Question Box (Q)](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-details\#_671-question-box-q)

Each

ALLIANCE

has a designated Question Box near the scoring table. If a DRIVE TEAM has a question about a

MATCH

, the

FIELD

, etc., they may send up to 2 DRIVE TEAM members to their corresponding Question Box. Depending on timing, the Head

REFEREE

or

FTA

may postpone any requested discussion until the end of the subsequent

MATCH

.

Technical questions regarding

FIELD

or

ROBOT

operation are addressed by the

FTA

, and additional team members are invited to participate in these conversations if necessary. If a DRIVE TEAM needs clarification on a ruling or score, per Q101, up to 2 DRIVE TEAM members should address the Head

REFEREE

after the

ARENA

Reset Signal (e.g.

FIELD

lights turn green).

While

FMS

tracks quantities of MINOR and MAJOR FOULS, FIRST instructs

REFEREES

to not self-track details about MINOR FOULS and MAJOR FOULS; as a result,

REFEREES

are not expected to recall details about what MINOR FOULS and MAJOR FOULS were made, when they occurred, and against whom.

Any reasonable question is fair game in the Question Box, and Head

REFEREES

will make good faith efforts to provide helpful feedback (e.g. how/why certain MINOR FOULS are being called, why a particular

ROBOT

may be susceptible to certain MINOR FOULS based on its design or game play, how specific rules are being called or interpreted), but please know that they may not be able to supply specific details.

Q101 \*Head

REFEREE

Interactions. A team may only address the Head

REFEREE

with maximum of 2 people, 1 of which must be a

STUDENT

.

Violation: The Head

REFEREE

will not address non-compliant team members or peripheral conversations.

Some events may restrict

ARENA

access to members of the DRIVE TEAM. Team members are permitted to swap buttons within their team as needed to access the Question Box.

As much as possible, the

STUDENT

should be an active participant in the conversation.

Teams should not record interactions without consent (see E117).

Q102 Conversations must be civil. Any team interaction with the Head

REFEREE

must be appropriate.

Violation: The Head

REFEREE

may terminate the conversation to allow time for parties to cool down. A person with subsequent violations will not be allowed to interact with the Head

REFEREE

.

Examples of inappropriate behavior are outlined in G201.

## [6.8 Other Logistics](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/game-details\#_68-other-logistics)

SCORING ELEMENTS that leave the

FIELD

(other than through the

OUTPOST

) are placed back into the

FIELD

approximately at the point of exit by

FIELD

STAFF (

REFEREES

,

FTAs

, or other staff working around the

FIELD

) at the earliest safe opportunity.

Note that

ROBOTS

and HUMAN PLAYERS may not deliberately cause SCORING ELEMENTS to leave the

FIELD

(see G405).

An

ARENA

FAULT (an error in

ARENA

operation described in section 10.2

MATCH

Replays) is not called for

MATCHES

that accidentally begin with damaged SCORING ELEMENTS. Damaged SCORING ELEMENTS are not replaced until the next

ARENA

reset period. DRIVE TEAMS should alert the

FIELD

STAFF to any missing or damaged SCORING ELEMENTS prior to the start of the

MATCH

but as noted in 6.3.4, the exact number of

FUEL

in the NEUTRAL ZONE may vary.

Once the

MATCH

is over and the Head

REFEREE

determines that the

FIELD

is safe for

FIELD

STAFF and DRIVE TEAMS, they or their designee change the

FIELD

lights to green and DRIVE TEAMS may retrieve their

ROBOT

. Some

MATCHES

may include a short period afterward to allow

FIELD

staff to begin to clean the

field

to make it easier and safer for teams to collect their

robot

. This period is indicated with purple lights on the team signs and the word “clean” displayed. TEAMS are not allowed on the

field

during this time.

During

ARENA

reset, the

ARENA

is cleared of

ROBOTS

and OPERATOR CONSOLES from the

MATCH

that just ended,

ROBOTS

and OPERATOR CONSOLES for the subsequent

MATCH

are loaded into the

ARENA

by DRIVE TEAMS, and

FIELD

STAFF reset

ARENA

elements.

FIRST Robotics Competition uses 3 words in the context of how durations and actions are assessed with regards to evaluation of rules and assignment of violations. These words provide general guidance to describe benchmarks to be used across the program. It is not the intent for

REFEREES

to provide a count during the time periods.

- MOMENTARY


describes durations that are fewer than approximately 3 seconds.
- CONTINUOUS


describes durations that are more than approximately 10 seconds.
- REPEATED


describes actions that happen more than once within a


MATCH


.
