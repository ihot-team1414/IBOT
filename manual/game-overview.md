# 4 Game Overview

![image](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2026/Manual/HTML/2026GameManual_files/image013.png)

In REBUILTTM presented by Haas, two competing

alliances

are invited to score

fuel

, cross obstacles, and climb the

tower

before time runs out.

Alliances

earn additional rewards for meeting specific scoring thresholds.

During the first 20 seconds of the

match

,

robots

are autonomous. Without guidance from their

drivers

,

robots

score

fuel

into their

hub

.

Fuel

can be pre-loaded into a

robot

, obtained from the human player, collected at the

depot

, or picked up throughout the center of the

field

. Some

robots

may also climb the

tower

to obtain additional points.

During the remaining 2 minutes and 20 seconds,

drivers

control

their

robots

. Based on the result of autonomous play,

alliance

hubs

will alternate between active and inactive, shifting gameplay between both sides of the

field

.

Robots

can collect

fuel

at any point in the

match

and may

control

any amount of

fuel

at a time.

Drivers

control

their

robots

to score

fuel

into their

hub

while it is active and may perform defensive strategies or collect more

fuel

while their

hub

is inactive.

As time runs out, all

hubs

become active, allowing all

robots

to score.

Robots

can climb to the

tower

’s highest heights to score additional points and claim

match

bonuses to increase their position in the rankings.

The

alliance

that earns the most points wins the

match

!
