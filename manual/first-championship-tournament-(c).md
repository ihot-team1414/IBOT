# 13 FIRST Championship Tournament (C)

At the 2026 FIRST Championship presented by BAE Systems, teams are split into 8 divisions. The process used to assign teams to their division is as follows:

- Teams requesting accessible seating are split amongst the divisions.
- Rookies are randomized and then assigned sequentially to divisions, skipping a division for each rookie assigned in Step 1 (i.e. a team in Division 1, a team in Division 2, a team in Division 3, a team in Division 4, a team in Division 5, a team in Division 6, a team in Division 7, a team in Division 8, then back to Division 1 again, until Rookies are all assigned to a division).
- Step 2 is


repeated


with veteran teams, with additional assignments as necessary to balance the total teams in each division.

Each division plays a standard tournament as described in section 10.5 Qualification

MATCHES

and section 10.6 Playoff

MATCHES

to produce the division Champions. Those 8 division Champions proceed to the Championship Playoffs, on the Einstein

FIELDS

, to determine the 2026 FIRST Robotics Competition Championship Winners, per section 13.4 FIRST Championship Playoffs.

## [13.1 Advancement to the FIRST Championship](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/first-championship-tournament-(c)\#_131-advancement-to-the-first-championship)

Details on how teams earn eligibility to attend the FIRST Championship can be found in section 11.5 FIRST Championship Eligibility and section 12.2 FIRST Championship Eligibility. Teams that are pre-qualified can be found on the [FIRST Championship eligibility webpage](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/frc/championship-eligibility-criteria).

## [13.2 4-ROBOT \ \ ALLIANCES](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/first-championship-tournament-(c)\#_132-4-robot-alliances)

There is no provision for BACKUP TEAMS at the FIRST Championship.

Instead, before each division Playoff Tournament,

ALLIANCES

are selected per the process as described in section 10.6.1

ALLIANCE

Selection Process, however the process continues with a third round of selection as follows.

Round 3: The same method is used for each

ALLIANCE

CAPTAIN’S third choice except the selection order is reversed again, with

ALLIANCE

1 picking first and

ALLIANCE

8 picking last. This process results in 8

ALLIANCES

of 4 teams each.

ALLIANCES

may start with any 3 of the 4

ROBOTS

on their

ALLIANCE

during division Playoff

MATCHES

and during the Championship Playoffs.

ALLIANCES

submit

LINEUPS

for their

MATCHES

as described in section 10.6.4

LINEUPS

.

## [13.3 FIRST Championship Pit Crews](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/first-championship-tournament-(c)\#_133-first-championship-pit-crews)

FIRST distributes buttons to the

ALLIANCE

CAPTAINS during the

ALLIANCE

CAPTAIN meeting, which takes place on the division

FIELDS

. These buttons provide the necessary access to the

ARENA

for pit crew members.

### [C301 \*Wear your buttons.](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/first-championship-tournament-(c)\#c301-wear-your-buttons)

Only team members wearing proper buttons are allowed on the

ARENA

floor during division and Playoff

MATCHES

.

Violation:

MATCH

won’t start until the situation is corrected. Those not displaying identification must leave the

ARENA

.

Teams should assume they may be chosen for an

ALLIANCE

and think about the logistics of button distribution and set a plan prior to the

ALLIANCE

selection process. It is each

ALLIANCE

CAPTAIN’S responsibility to distribute buttons to their pit crew members.

## [13.4 FIRST Championship Playoffs](https://www.frcmanual.com/2026/first-championship-tournament-(c)\#_134-first-championship-playoffs)

The 8 division Champions play a Double Elimination style tournament as described in section 10.6 Playoff

MATCHES

to determine the 2026 FIRST Robotics Competition Champions. Exact

MATCH

timing is provided to FIRST Championship Playoff teams.

ALLIANCES

are paired as shown in Figure 13‑1.

During the Einstein Finals, if the

MATCH

score of each

ALLIANCE

is equal, the

MATCH

is replayed. In this circumstance, the

LINEUP

may be changed.
